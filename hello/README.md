## Program compilation and execution

In this exercise you will compile a simple Fortran program, and experiment
with variable declarations and assignments.

1. Compile the supplied “Hello world”-program [hello.F90](hello.F90) and run it. 

2. Modify the program such that you define some variables and assign values
to them. Try different types of numbers, logical values as well as strings.

3. Make some (likely less meaningful) computations using those variables and
print out the values of those. Try to mix `integer`, `real` and `complex` types in
computations and check how automatic type conversions behave (`real` ->
`integer`, `integer` -> `real`, `complex` -> `integer`, etc.)
