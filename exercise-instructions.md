## General exercise instructions

For most of the exercises, skeleton codes are provided in the corresponding 
subdirectory. Some exercise skeletons have sections marked with “TODO” for 
completing the exercises. In addition, all of the
exercises have exemplary full codes (that can be compiled and run) in the
`solutions` folder. Note that these are seldom the only or even the best way to
solve the problem.

### CSC Training class

The exercises should be done with the local workstations in CSC Training 
class. If you have Fortran compiler installed it is also possible to
use your own laptop / computer system.

For editing program source files you can use e.g. nano editor

```
nano prog.f90
```

Also other popular editors (vim, emacs, gedit) are available.

### Compilation and execution

Compilation of the source codes is performed by default with the GNU compiler
using `gfortran` command:
```
$ gfortran -o hello hello.F90
```

The resulting binary can then be executed as
```
$ ./hello
```
