## General exercise instructions

For most of the exercises, skeleton codes are provided in the corresponding 
subdirectory. Some exercise skeletons have sections marked with “TODO” for 
completing the exercises. In addition, all of the
exercises have exemplary full codes (that can be compiled and run) in the
`solutions` folder. Note that these are seldom the only or even the best way to
solve the problem.

The exercise material can be downloaded with the command

```
git clone https://github.com/csc-training/fortran-introduction.git
```
If you have a GitHub account you can also **Fork** this repository and
clone then your fork.

Exercises can be carried out on any Linux/Unix platform with Fortran
compiler, or you can use CSC's Puhti.

### Using Puhti

See Puhti quick guide
[here](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/puhti_quick/) for general
instructions on using Puhti. You can use either you own CSC account or
a training account provided by the lecturer.

For editing program source files you can use e.g. *nano* editor:

```
nano prog.f90 &
```
(`^` in nano's shortcuts refer to **Ctrl** key, *i.e.* in order to save
file and exit editor press `Ctrl+X`). Also other popular editors (emacs,
vim, gedit) are available.
