## Using the array syntax in Laplacian

In this exercise you can try more complex operations with array syntax.

Go back to the exercise [finite-difference Laplacian](../finite-difference) 
and implement the finite-difference evaluation using array syntax and
proper array sections. You can start from the skeleton code
[laplacian.F90](laplacian.F90) and use the [model
solution](../finite-difference/solution/laplacian.F90) of the previous
exercise as inspiration.
