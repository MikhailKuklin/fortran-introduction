## Intrinsic modules and type precision

In this exercise you should utilize the `iso_fortran_env` intrinsic
module.

Start from your own solution to [Finite-difference
Laplacian](../finite-difference) exercise or the provided skeleton
code [laplacian.F90](laplacian.F90).

Declare all floating point numbers with double precision (64 bit)
precision. It is recommend to define the precision in a separete
module which you `use` in the main program.

In the main program, also write out the compiler command and compiler options.
