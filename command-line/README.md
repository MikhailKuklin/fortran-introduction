## Command line arguments
Modify the given template so that the command line arguments are read in the following way:
1. If no command line arguments are given, program prints out a short notice.
2. If one argument is given, it is interpreted as a string and the value is stored to a variable called input_file.
3. If two arguments are given, first argument is interpreted as in case 2 and the second argument is treated as an integer value and stored to a variable called nsteps.
4. If three arguments are given then they all are interpreted as integers and values are stored to variables rows, cols and nsteps in this order.
