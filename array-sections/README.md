## Array sections

In this exercise you can practice using array *sections* in Fortran. 

Starting with the skeleton code [sections.F90](sections.F90):

1. Extract every element from the second row.
2. Extract every element from the third column.
3. Assign a value of 99 to upper left 2x2 subarray.
4. Finally, fill the array with the checkerboard pattern, i.e. alternating 
   zeros and ones:
   ```
    1 0 1 ...
    0 1 0 ...
    1 0 1 ...
    ...
    ```
