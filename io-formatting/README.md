# IO formatting and simple file IO

Start from the template file [formatting.F90](formatting.F90) and do
the following steps:

1. Open a file for writing with name *my-file.txt*
2. Write out variables `string_value`, `int_value` and `real_value`
   using formatting that gives you a line like this: `My values are 87
   and 0.343`. HINT: you can add text also into the format string, for
   example `'(I," is not same as ",F)'`
3. Close the file

Check that the output is correct.
