## Simple derived type

In this exercise you can practice making a procedure interface more
compact with the help of derived types.

The main program [derived-types.F90](derived-types.F90) and the module
[coulomb.F90](coulomb.F90) contain code that calculate the force
between two charged particles.

Implement a derived type for charged particle in the
[coulomb.F90](coulomb.F90) module, and use that both in the main
program and in the module procedure.
