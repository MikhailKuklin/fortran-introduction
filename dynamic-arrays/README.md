## Dynamic arrays and array intrinsincs
a) Define a matrix A which should be dynamically allocatable. Then
allocate the matrix with sizes read in from the user input and fill the matrix
with random numbers using the array intrinsic function `random_number`.

b) Then use suitable array intrinsic functions to print out the following
details:
 - What is the sum of elements across the 2nd dimension of A?
 - Find the location coordinates of the maximum elements of A.
 - What is the absolute minimum value of the array A?
 - Are all elements of A greater than or equal to zero?
 - How many elements of A are greater than or equal to 0.5?

There is a skeleton code being provided in [array.F90](array.F90).
