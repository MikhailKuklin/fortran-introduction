## Module variable scoping

### Simple counter module

Implement a simple counter module with a private integer counter
variable. The value of counter should only be
manipulated using module procedures. Implement following procedures:

 - `counter_init` that initializes the counter to a given integer value
 - `counter_increment` that increments the counter by one
 - `counter_print` that prints out the counter value

The provided skeleton `main.F90` assumes that the counter module is
called `counter`. In the counter module, Use variable name `count`,
which is same as the loop variable in the main program.
